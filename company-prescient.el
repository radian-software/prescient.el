;;; Commentary:

;; company-prescient.el provides an interface for using prescient.el
;; to sort Company completions. To enable its functionality, turn on
;; `company-prescient-mode' in your init-file or interactively.

;; Note that company-prescient.el does not change the filtering
;; behavior of Company. This is because that can't be done without
;; updating each Company backend individually.

;; For more information, see https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el.
