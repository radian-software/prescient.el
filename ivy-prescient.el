;; ivy-prescient.el provides an interface for using prescient.el to
;; sort and filter candidates in Ivy menus. To enable its
;; functionality, turn on `ivy-prescient-mode' in your init-file or

`ivy-minibuffer-match-face-4'. With a non-nil value, substring
matches are also highlighted using `ivy-minibuffer-match-face-2'
through `ivy-minibuffer-match-face-4', meaning that the only use
of `ivy-minibuffer-match-face-1' is in between the initials of an
initialism.

Note that a non-nil value for this variable emulates the
highlighting behavior of `ivy--regex-ignore-order', not the

out-of-order matching."
