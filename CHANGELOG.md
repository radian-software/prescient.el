# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog].

## Unreleased
### New features
* The user option `prescient-filter-method` now accepts a list of
  filter methods that will be applied in order until one matches. This
  allows for any combination of filter methods ([#29]). The default
  value has changed from `literal+initialism` to `(literal regexp
  initialism)`, which provides a superset of functionality.
* Two new user options, `ivy-prescient-enable-filtering` and
  `ivy-prescient-enable-sorting`, which allow the user to selectively
  disable the filtering or sorting functionalities of
  `ivy-prescient.el` ([#32]).

### Enhancements
* Previously, if you had set `prescient-filter-method` to `regexp` and
  entered an invalid regexp with `ivy-prescient.el`, then the
  candidate list would not update. Now, the list is cleared until your
  regexp is valid again. This behavior is more consistent and
  predictable.
* Previously, `ivy-prescient.el` would only remember directories that
  the user operated on with an action (for example, opening them with
  Dired). Now it will remember all intermediate directories used in
  navigation ([#36]).

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed sorting in filename-based collections ([#28]).
* Fixed an issue where Ivy actions that accepted a list of candidates
  were being handled incorrectly ([#33]).

### Removed
* Removed `ivy-prescient-filter-method-keys` and
  `ivy-prescient-persist-filter-method` because `regexp` is now part
  of the default filter method, and therefore these are no longer
  needed ([#15], [#24], and [#27]).
* Removed `ivy-prescient-excluded-commands` because `ivy-prescient.el`
  now automatically detects if sorting is enabled in a collection.

## 2.2.2 (released 2019-02-12)
### Enhancements
* The Custom groups for the user options `prescient-persist-mode`,
  `ivy-prescient-mode`, and `company-prescient-mode` have now been set
  properly to `prescient` (instead of each being in its own group).

### Bugs fixed
* `ivy-prescient` now depends on version 0.11.0 of `ivy`, rather than
  0.10.0. This [long-awaited] release includes a number of bugfixes
  which are critical for correct operation of `ivy-prescient`.

## 2.2.1 (released 2018-09-22)
### Fixed
* Previously, if the user or some other code had customized
  `print-length` or `print-level`, then these settings could break the
  ability of `prescient.el` to persist history and frequency data to
  `prescient-save-file`. Now, persistence works regardless of the
  values of these variables ([#16]).

## 2.2 (released 2018-08-23)
### New features
* New user option `prescient-filter-method` allows you to use
  substring, initialism, regexp, or fuzzy matching ([#13]).
* By default, you can use `C-c C-r` in Ivy to toggle between
  substring/initialism matching and regexp matching. Bindings can be
  customized in the new user option
  `ivy-prescient-filter-method-keys`. By default, the changes do not
  persist between Ivy sessions, but this can be customized using the
  new user option `ivy-prescient-persist-filter-method`.

### Deprecated
* The function `prescient-initials-regexp` is now considered
  deprecated and it should not be used. Changes to its behavior will
  however be documented until it is removed in a future release.

[#13]: https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el/issues/13

## 2.1 (released 2018-07-25)
### New features
* New user option `ivy-prescient-retain-classic-highlighting` allows
  you to more closely emulate the highlighting behavior of Ivy when
  `ivy-prescient-mode` is enabled ([#11]).

### Enhancements
* API function `prescient-filter-regexps` now has special behavior
  when the symbol `all` is passed as the `WITH-GROUPS` argument. The
  documentation string for this function, which was previously
  erroneous, has been fixed ([#11]).
* For some reason, Ivy explicitly supports candidates which are lists,
  by just taking their cars. `ivy-prescient.el` now does the same,
  instead of converting the lists to strings. This reduces bloat in
  the save file, and in some cases improves frequency tracking (for
  example, frequency tracking works much better for
  `org-refile-get-location`).

## 2.0 (released 2018-06-26)
### Changed
* `ivy-prescient.el` now clears the value of
  `ivy-initial-inputs-alist` when `ivy-prescient-mode` is enabled, in
  order to allow functions like `counsel-describe-function` to work
  out of the box ([#7]).

### Fixed
* Previously, `ivy-prescient.el` didn't work with the latest version
  of `counsel-projectile` because that package relied on certain
  undocumented semantics of the `ivy-read` API. This is now fixed
  ([#6]).
