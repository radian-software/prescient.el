;;; Commentary:

;; prescient.el is a general-purpose library for sorting and filtering
;; candidates.

;; The algorithm of prescient.el is very simple. You enter a query, or
;; multiple queries separated by spaces (two spaces match a literal
;; space), and each query filters the candidates by matching either a
;; substring (e.g. "scient" matches "prescient-frequency-threshold")
;; or initialism (e.g. "ft" also matches the same). Then, candidates
;; are sorted to prioritize recently chosen candidates, followed by
;; frequently chosen candidates, with the remaining candidates sorted
;; by length.

;; prescient.el aims to replace a number of other packages, including
;; IDO, Smex, Flx, Historian, and Company-Statistics. It also replaces
;; the sorting and filtering functionalities of completion frameworks
;; such as Helm and Ivy.

;; To use prescient.el for Ivy, see ivy-prescient.el. To use
;; prescient.el for Company, see company-prescient.el. In either case,
;; you will most likely want your usage statistics to be saved across
;; Emacs sessions; to do this, enable `prescient-persist-mode' in your
;; init-file or interactively.

;; For more information, see https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el.

  "How to interpret prescient.el filtering queries.
Queries are first split on spaces (with two consecutive spaces
standing for a literal space). Then, the candidates are filtered
using each subquery in turn. This variable affects how that
filtering takes place.

Value `literal' means the subquery must be a substring of the
candidate. Supports char folding.

Value `literal-prefix' means the first subquery must be the
prefix of the candidate and the remaining subqueries must be
prefixes of words in the candidate. Supports char folding.

Value `regexp' means the subquery is interpreted directly as a
regular expression.

Value `initialism' means the subquery must match a substring of
the initials of the candidate.

Value `fuzzy' means the characters of the subquery must match
some subset of those of the candidate, in the correct order but
not necessarily contiguous.

Value `prefix' means the words (substrings of only word
characters) match the beginning of words found in the candidate,
in order, separated by the same non-word characters that separate
words in the query. This is similar to the completion style
`partial'.

Value `anchored' means words are separated by capital letters or
symbols, with capital letters being the start of a new word. This
is similar to `prefix', but allows for less typing.

Value can also be a list of any of the above methods, in which
case each method will be applied in order until one matches.

Value can also be a function which returns any of the allowable
values documented above.

For backwards compatibility, the value of this variable can also
be `literal+initialism', which equivalent to the list (`literal'
`initialism')."

These symbols can be included in `prescient-filter-method', and

regexp, and keyword arguments of which there are currently:

    with-group      <bool-value-or-all>

The boolean keyword argument WITH-GROUP describes whether the
function should enclose matched text in a capture group (such as
with `prescient-with-group').  Additionally, if the value is the
symbol `all', then literal substrings should be enclosed in
capture groups.

The integer keyword argument SUBQUERY-NUMBER states the order of
how the input has been split into individual subqueries (starting
with 0).  For example, if the input was \"foo bar baz\" the
function will be called three times:
